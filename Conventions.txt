CRISPR-X wrapper script written by Hannah De Jong for Ashley lab use 
using code originally from Laure Fresard.

Assumes input of paired-end fastq sequencing files. Assumes run on the Stanford server Sherlock, which uses slurm. 

************** Required data formatting ***********

1. Create your data folder.
2. Within your data folder, create a folder called "seqs"
3. Inside your "seqs" folder, make two folders named "fastq" and "ref". 
4. In the "fastq" folder, place the fastq files from your sequencing run.
5. In the "ref" folder, place the fasta file of the gene or genome you want to align to. 

Fastq files must be (re)named sequentially as follows:

1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

2_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
2_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

3_S3_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
3_S3_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

...etc.


*************** Analysis *************

Run the following command:

./CX_analysis.bash DATA REF_NAME CHROM_NAME CODE FIRST_SAMPLE LAST_SAMPLE CTRL_SAMPLE

Provide complete file paths for only the "DATA" and "CODE" arguments. 

Parameters descriptions are as follows: 

DATA # Path to data
REF_NAME # Name of reference sequence fasta file
CHROM_NAME # Name of chromosome for alignment within reference sequence
CODE # Path to code
FIRST_SAMPLE # File number of first sample
LAST_SAMPLE # File number of last sample
CTRL_SAMPLE # File number of control sample


*********** Output **************

The folder "counts" will include summaries of mismatch counts for each sample.

The folder "enrichment" will contain pdf plots of enrichment for variants in each sample vs. the control sample.
